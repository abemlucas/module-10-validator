Create a number randomizer and loop through to create a 9 digit number.
Store these numbers in a CSV file.
Read the CSV file where the numbers are stored prior to running project.
Reverse the order of the numbers.
Take the digits found in the odd places of the reversed number.
Add those numbers and create a variable named s1.
Take the digits found in the even places of the reversed number.
Multiply them each by 2.
Record the digits if they are >9 to create partial sums. Otherwise keep the new number.
Sum up the new partial numbers or regular numbers*2 to create a variable named s2.
If s1 + s2 = a number ending with 0 . -> VALID or else -> FAKE.
Keep Looping through the CSV file until all the numbers are checked.
